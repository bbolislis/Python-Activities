# Python Activities

This repository is a collection of diverse Python scripts, each serving as a hands-on project to demonstrate and practice various programming concepts. The activities span from fundamental operations to more specialized tasks, making it an excellent resource for learning and experimentation.

## Overview

The projects within this collection cover several key areas of Python programming:

*   **File I/O:** Demonstrates reading from and writing to different file formats, including plain text (`.txt`) and comma-separated values (`.csv`).
*   **Data Manipulation:** Includes scripts for processing and transforming data, such as converting string formats and validating data using algorithms like the Luhn algorithm.
*   **Automation:** Provides examples of automating common tasks, such as organizing files in a directory and interacting with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.
*   **Command-Line Applications:** Features simple interactive command-line tools, like an expense tracker.
*   **Cryptography:** Contains a basic implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher for encrypting and decrypting text.

## Purpose

This collection is intended for those looking to practice their Python skills with practical, self-contained examples. Each script is designed to be straightforward and focused on a specific objective.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently from the command line:

```bash
python path/to/script_name.py
```
